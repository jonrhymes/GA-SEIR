<h3>Client vs. Server</h3>

Client versus Server represents the opposing sides of where an application code runs. 
A client is typically a computer application, desktop, phone, etc. that allows a user to send and receive information (as packets) to and from a server. 
The server is data storage that responds to a client's request. Clients and servers both have IP addresses, Internet Protocol addresses, which is a unique address.

<h3>Request-Response cycle</h3>

When a client sends a request for data, the server responds by delivering the request. Intermediaries like routers assist with shuttling this information.

<h3>Define html</h3>

It is the request-response protocol, or set of rules and standards, which encompasses most, if not all, transmission of information from one computer to another, allowing networks to "talk" to each other. It is the language used to communicate between web browsers and servers.
